# OpenParrot MT
Hyperspecialised fork of OpenParrot for Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune.  
Based on [OpenParrot Asakura](https://github.com/ProjectAsakura/OpenParrot).  

## Disclaimer
Please do not ask me to contribute to the TeknoParrot project. I will decline. I will only reconsider if you make the ENTIRETY of TeknoParrot COMPLETELY open-source.

## How to use
Don't, yet. (But you'd be able to use it with TeknoParrotUI or something.)  
No technical support is provided.
